#
# functional goal___________

# interaction via clicking on the card itself, which will send the user to
# the full content page to view the entire article/content/guide/tutorial/etc
#
# example-content -> displayed information ==> action-on-interaction:
# news/article/tutorial/guide -> detailed info ==> full-content-page
# 
# Example Output: {"authors":[],
